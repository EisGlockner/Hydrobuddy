I should revisit this Project again, clean the code up, make it as bugfree as possible and fix some Hardwarestuff.

Pins:
    HX711:
        GPIO_NUM_18: Clock
        GPIO_NUM_19: Data
    
    LED Strip:
        GPIO_NUM_15: Data
    
    Onboard LED:
        GPIO_NUM_2 - this doesn't exist on the new boards
